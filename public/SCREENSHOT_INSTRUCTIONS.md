# How to add your demo screenshot

1. Take a screenshot of your weather app in action
2. Save it as 'demo.png'
3. Place it in the public/ folder
4. The README will automatically display it

For best results:
- Use a 16:9 aspect ratio
- Show the app with some weather data displayed
- Ensure the image is clear and well-lit
- Maximum size should be 1200px wide
